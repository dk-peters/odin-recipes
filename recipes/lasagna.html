    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish is a simple, easy-to-make lasagna with a soft, creamy texture. Using oven-ready lasagna sheets, this recipe saves time, making it a great choice for a weeknight.</p>
    <p>By omitting an egg in the cream filling, you ensure that the inside of the lasagna remains soft and flavorful, while the oven-ready lasagna sheets give it structural integrity.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 sweet yellow onion (diced)</li>
        <li>Olive oil as needed (roughly 4-6 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>1 pound sweet (or mild) Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 jar garlic and basil spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 15-oz container of ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>3 large cloves of garlic (minced or pressed)</li>
        <li>1 small bag of grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese (to serve with lasagna)</li>
        <li>1 box Barilla oven-ready lasagna noodles (you'll only use about 1/2 of the box)</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons Italian seasoning blend</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Making the Sauces</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté onion in olive oil on high until onions are translucent, then add italian sausage and cook
until completely browned</li>
        <li>Drain grease from meat and add pasta sauce</li>
        <li>sauce. Once it is boiling, reduce
heat to a simmer</li>
        <li>While sauce is simmering, mix ricotta with garlic, 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil and Italian
seasonings</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350F and assemble the lasagna</li>
            
    </ol>
    <h3>Assembling the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Use a 9”x9” baking dish to assemble the lasagna (or larger if you have it). The deeper the pan, the better. To assemble:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put some pasta sauce in the bottom of the baking dish (enough to cover the bottom, but not a ton)</li>
        <li>Place 2 layers of the dry pasta noodles over the pasta sauce in the baking dish. (You can break the noodles
            if you need to in order to cover extra spaces, but they expand when they cook, so it's not an exact science)</li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 of the ricotta mixture over the pasta noodles</li>
        <li>Spread some mozzarella over the ricotta</li>
        <li>Spread some pasta sauce over the cheese</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Repeat steps 2-5, so that your lasagna is 2 layers deep, top with remaining sauce and a bit of
cheese. (You need to make sure you leave about at least ½ inch of room between the top of the
casserole and the top of the dish to keep it from bubbling over.) Be sure to leave enough room to
end with a sauce layer on top.</p>
    <p>Bake at 350 for 45-60 minutes until casserole is bubbling and top is browned. Remove from the
oven and let it set for 20-30 minutes before serving. <strong>Mangia!</strong></p>
